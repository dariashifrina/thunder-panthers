ThunderPanthers -- 2017-11-13 13:09
First idea: decided to use football and baseball player APIs to compare stats and get the winning player.
Created repo and started design doc.

ThunderPanthers -- 2017-11-14 13:11
Second idea: decided to use Yandex Translate API and Getty Images APIs to create a comic strip that translates inputted text multiple times to create a funny meme.
Linked submodule.

ThunderPanthers -- 2017-11-15 13:05
Final idea: decided to use Words API and Getty Images APIs to create a comic strip that translates inputted text using the synonyms of ach noun. Worked on component and sitemaps.

dariaS -- 2017-11-15 21:33
Created devlog.

jawadulK -- 2017-11-15 23:00
Created component map.

karinaI -- 2017-11-15 22:00
Created site map.

ThunderPanthers -- 2017-11-16 13:10
Finished design doc.

dariaS -- 2017-11-19 17:43
Incorporated design doc suggestions from other teams(clarified Foreword and tasks).

ThunderPanthers -- 2017-11-21 12:57
Created necessary files from designdoc. Added "getty.py" from Karina's API assignment.

karinaI -- 2017-11-22 13:19
Worked on parsing strings to find nouns and then getting synonyms for those nouns from the Words API.

taylorW -- 2017-11-19 13:10
Implementing basic Bootsrap for index.html.

jawadulK -- 2017-11-22 13:18
Started translation functions. Basically pseudocode at the moment.

karinaI -- 2017-11-24 11:32
Found Datamuse API, which is better for our project than Words API because Words API requires credit card information. Created get_adj(word) and get_syn(word) which used Datamuse to return synonyms and adjectives for given words. Created new_sent which uses get_adj, get_syn, and a list of words to keep to create a new sentence. It works on a basic level, but still needs some touching up.

taylorW -- 2017-11-24 13:44
Used Bootstrap and coolors.co to modify html templates, created new css folder and files, created favicon for website.

taylorW -- 2017-11-24 16:04
Added jinja to html files, made aesthetic mods. Added title and name for adding best comics.

taylorW -- 2017-11-26 00:30
Colors and such (I was bored).

jawadulK -- 2017-11-26 3:18
Finished translation function, basic comic silly phrases in place
Bug: When converting to a language with foreign characters, there is a problem with conversion.
Right now it only translates English to English.

karinaI -- 2017-11-26 15:20
Looked at Azure text analytics API in search of part-of-speech APIs. It also required credit card info. Found textRazor API. It has a limit of 500 requests per day but the API key is easily procurable and it does the job.

karinaI -- 2017-11-26 16:48
Changed the sentence changing function to use parts of speech from the textRazor API. This should make the sentences gramatically correct. However I have yet to fix 1 bug: even when the conditional for case 1b in the function renders False, the second part of the conditional is executed. Once that is fixed, the function should be completed.

karinaI -- 2017-11-26 18:43
I fixed the bug and re-discovered that the truth value of a non-empty string is True. The sentence generator works now.
Modified new_sent(sentence) to work with punctuation. (jawadul pointed out that was an issue)

jawadulK -- 2017-11-26 18:30
Fixed utf-8 encoding error, now translates into other languages properly.
A big problem is that it takes very long to translate even a few times.

jawadulK -- 2017-11-26 21:55
Implemented synonyms into comic generation
A big problem is that when looking for synonyms of a sentence with a period within it, it gives an index error
This is magnified by the fact that certain translations create periods within the sentence

taylorW -- 2017-11-26 23:01
Added base.html to robustify html temaplates using jinja. Worked on trying to solve 404 css/localhost problems.

dariaS -- 2017-11-27 12:57
Fixed localhost problem by adding static folder and moving css there. Page can now be rendered.

karinaI and jawadulK -- 2017-11-27 13:19
Fixed new_sent(sentence) to work with multiple sentences and thus fixed the bugs on the /comic page.

dariaS -- 2017-11-27 22:59
Updated README with clear launching instructions.

karinaI -- 2017-11-28 0:13
Created img_text(sentence) function which takes a sentence and parses it to generate a list containing possible phrases for the comic strip image. For example: "The elephant runs to the big store." produces ["elephant runs", "big store"]. Also created /getty route which demonstrates img_text functionality and offers multiple image options with descriptions from the getty API.

dariaS -- 2017-11-28 1:00
Added SQL database for saving funny comics.

dariaS -- 2017-11-28 18:20
Created util for feed. Reworked structure of database so that it wouldn't redundantly store the same piece of HTML, instead it will store all individual components to be displayed through the while loop. Worked on adding new entries and converting db table into a dictionary.

dariaS -- 2017-11-28 19:15
Debugged feed util fxns through app.py. Did not have a chance to test with silly comics yet.

jawadulK -- 2017-11-28 20:12
Implemented a loop that repeatedly tries to mash sentences because inconsistencies in the translation output are inevitable.

jawadulK -- 2017-11-28 21:13
Made the index page send a POST request to the comic function, which reads the data and uses it.

karinaI -- 2017-11-28 21:39
Updated img_text(sentence) and img_url(sentence) to get rid of bugs and improve image accuracy by returning random elements of the img_text phrases list (and avoiding first element if possible.)

jawadulK -- 2017-11-28 23:27
Testing the requests and flashing an error if necessary

taylorW -- 2017-11-28 23:45
Making vaious edits including level dropdown, message flashing, submitting, and posting silly comics, working on navbar adjustment

jawadulK -- 2017-11-29 00:45
Implemented different levels of silliness

dariaS -- 2017-11-29 1:30
Feed works whoop whoop!!! Fixed minor HTML error in frontend that only passed the first word of every silly phrase, which messed with the entire process of rendering the comic.

jawadulK -- 2017-11-29 01:45
Removed all built-in API keys and made all functions run on user-given API keys.

dariaS -- 2017-11-29 2:16
Updated design doc to reflect new database scheme.
