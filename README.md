Introducing...the broken telephone version of comic strips. User will enter four phrases which will be turned into two comic strips. Firstly, the phrases will be incorporated into a 2x2 comic strip with images generated from the words entered. Most importantly, a second comic strip will be created with a “broken telephone” version of the original phrase with relevant images. Funnies can be saved to the “Best Humor” page.
